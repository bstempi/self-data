Self-Data
=========

This repo is used to track and publish data about myself.

I decided to start tracking energy drink consumption.  If I'm going to track it, I might as well make a project out of it and open the door to tracking other things about myself.

Data Structure
==============
Each subject that I'm tracking will have its own directory, which will have 1 or more TSV files within it.  Instead of including headers, each directory will contain a README.md detailing the layout of the data source.  This makes it easy for me to update the data and makes it easy to consume/process the data.
