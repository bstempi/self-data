Energy Drink Consumption
========================

This data source is about my energy drink consumption.  The columns are: 

* date (yyyy-mm-dd)
* time (hh:00), because I don't track what minute I had the drink in.  Time is in 24-hour format, EST.
* brand (Redbull, Monster, etc)
* subbrand (sugar free, Khaos, etc, with respect to the brand example)

The files will be names so that their order lexographically is the same chronologically.
